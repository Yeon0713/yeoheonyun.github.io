                <h2>MY INTRODUCTION</h2>
                <p>I am a sophomore in the <a href="https://cse.kangwon.ac.kr/cse/index.do" target="_blank">Computer Science and Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.kangwon.ac.kr" target="_blank">Kangwon National University</a>, South Korea. I graduated from Seongwon Elementary School, Daeryong Middle School, and Kangwon High School. I served in the Republic of Korea Army for one and a half years and performed duties as a reservist unit instructor.</p>
                <p>In terms of my academic journey, I have pursued a diverse set of courses that have honed my skills and knowledge in various areas. My coursework includes subjects like Writing and Speaking, Logic of Coding, Communication English, Introduction to Programming, An Introduction to Computers, Python, C Programming, Object-Oriented Programming, Probability and Statistics, Badminton, Ski, C++ Programming, Linux Programming, Web Programming, Data Structures, Discrete Mathematics, and Advanced Python Programming. These courses have provided me with a solid foundation in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science.</p>
                <p>Outside of academics, I have a range of hobbies that I am passionate about. I enjoy bowling, skiing, and gaming. Bowling is an activity I frequently engage in with friends, always striving to achieve high scores. Skiing provides me with a thrilling experience and I often go on ski trips with friends, capturing memorable moments. Gaming is another significant passion of mine, where I enjoy reaching new ranks and achievements in my favorite games. These hobbies not only offer relaxation but also opportunities to build skills such as strategic thinking and coordination.</p>
                <p>By balancing my studies with my hobbies, I aim to develop a well-rounded skill set that encompasses both my professional aspirations and personal interests. My experiences in the military, coupled with my academic and extracurricular pursuits, have equipped me with a unique perspective and a robust set of skills, which I believe will be invaluable in my future endeavors.</p>

            <h2>HOBBY</h2>
            <p>I enjoy various activities in my free time. My favorite hobbies are bowling, skiing, and gaming. Here are some moments from these activities:</p>
            <div class="hobby-item">
                <h3>Bowling</h3>

                    <div class="hobby-text">
                        <p>Bowling is one of my favorite leisure activities. I started bowling as a fun activity with friends, but over time, it has become more than just a hobby. I often participate in local bowling tournaments and enjoy the competitive spirit. One of my most memorable moments was when I bowled a perfect game, achieving a score of 300. The precision and consistency required in bowling have taught me a lot about focus and discipline. I love the camaraderie and the excitement that comes with each game.</p>

                    <div class="hobby-text">
                        <p>Skiing is another activity that I am passionate about. The thrill of gliding down snow-covered slopes is unparalleled. I usually plan ski trips with friends and family during the winter season. One of my favorite skiing destinations is the Alpensia Resort in Pyeongchang, South Korea, which hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics. Skiing has not only been a source of excitement but also a great way to stay fit and appreciate nature. The skills required for skiing, such as balance and coordination, have positively impacted my overall physical abilities.</p>

                        <p>Gaming has been a significant part of my life since childhood. It started as a simple pastime but has grown into a serious hobby. I enjoy a variety of games, including strategy, role-playing, and first-person shooters. Gaming has helped me develop quick decision-making skills and strategic thinking. One of my proudest achievements was reaching a high rank in a popular multiplayer game, which required teamwork and excellent communication skills. Gaming also provides a way to connect with friends from around the world, creating a global network of fellow gamers.</p>
